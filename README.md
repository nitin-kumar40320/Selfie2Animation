# Selfie2Anime
It is a fun project to implement a CartoonGAN from the basic and perform image cartoonisation on selfie images.

This is a model which takes a selfie image as input and converts it into anime like style. I plan to use adversarial training method to train this model.

The dataset contains several thousand samples of selfie images and face images of anime characters.

This project is an implementation of the CartoonGAN model proposed in the paper "[CartoonGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Photo Cartoonization]"(https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Chen_CartoonGAN_Generative_Adversarial_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf).

The main proposals in this paper include:
  - New and efficient Generator and Discriminator Architectures
  - A different content preservation loss function
  - Edge Blur Image Processing Technique for better Discriminator Training
